  <p>AI has always sparked controversy for many years now, due to the hot topic of AI "replacing us". Now a self-automated society run by AI is still not possible in this generation, but we will discover why AI, particularly Open-AI, is a Huge topic now.</p>

  <h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>
  <img src="IMG_20240111_131108.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Analytics Image" title="Analytics">
  <p>As you can see in this graph that in recent years, specifically the year 2021 to present, AI has been gaining quite a lot of attention over the media. They have been getting popular with media content online such as YouTube or TikTok videos, blog posts, and articles. Open Source AI was made specifically to aid humans, assisting us in various ways, like computing and procedures. However, many media outlets have portrayed them as a threat to online jobs in the near future, as even artists online are replaced by AI-produced arts.</p>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <h2 id="why-use">Why you should use them?</h2>
  <img src="IMG_20240111_140137.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Why Use Image" title="Why Use ChatGPT">
  <p>Open-AI, like ChatGPT, was created to be a helpful assistant for people to help with work and even for everyday life. It helps provide explanations on more complex topics to serve as a virtual tutor. Users can also ask for guides and clarifications, like checking for essays and grammars. ChatGPT also provides instant responses, reducing wait times for users seeking assistance. This makes it a useful tool that is easy to manage but very powerful.</p>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <h2 id="drawbacks">The Drawbacks</h2>
  <img src="IMG_20240111_140005.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Drawbacks Image" title="Drawbacks of AI">
  <p>Now, in recent times, with media portraying them as a threat to everyday life, some people are insecure that their influence may affect our virtual lives and may take over. This may seem scary, but it's still an exaggeration as AI is still in its development stage. Though they are powerful now, it's still not possible for AI to take over. Humans should learn not to be dependent on AI too much.</p>
