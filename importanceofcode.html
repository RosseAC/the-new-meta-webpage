  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Coding has been a staple now in many prestigious schools, and work relating to technology, but it gives people many unrelated topics for coding/Programming and that might give the regular person the mindset that coding is not fun, way too hard, and boring. But on this page, we will give you the reasons why coding/programming is important.</p>

  <!-- Section 1 -->
  <h2 id="creation">The Creation</h2>
  <img src="IMG_20240111_140933.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Creation Image" title="The Creation">
  <p>Coding at its surface level is portrayed as a tool to make a website, but this barely scratched the surface. Coding is the main building block for almost every application. Virtually, what you can create with coding is limitless. You could make a calculator, develop a game, program a robot or AI, create an application, and even make art out of codes, and that is just naming a few. You could do even more with code.</p>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <h2 id="history">The History</h2>
  <img src="IMG_20240111_141101.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="History Image" title="The History">
  <p>In the early 19th century, Ada Lovelace, regarded as the world's first programmer, collaborated with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine in the mid-1800s. She wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on a machine. The lines of code that were made back then were primarily with the binary system, which is 1 and 0, quite a lot of tedious work and hard to understand. Fast-forward to today, coding and learning its languages have now become very easy, with lots of tutorials online, and powerful coding languages like Python that are easy to read and versatile.</p>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <h2 id="importance">The Importance</h2>
  <img src="IMG_20240111_141156.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Importance Image" title="The Importance">
  <p>While reading the previous texts, you should have the basic understanding of why it is important to code. Coding is not just about lots of hard-to-read letters and numbers; it's an important aspect of one's life in the virtual environment. As you understand coding better, you would see it in a different light and appreciate the art of coding. In recent years, coding/programming has been getting a lot of attention worldwide. It's not long before coding becomes part of our everyday lives, so we need to learn more about them and understand their importance.</p>
