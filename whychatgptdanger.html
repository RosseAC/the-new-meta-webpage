    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>AI has amassed a lot of users in just the past 1 year, with having 1 million users in just 5 days we clearly see a big trend for this AI, and the big question for most of us is, is this Dangerous? With just a small amount of time lots of people hopped in on this Open AI trend, and got to witness its capacity, it is even better than most humans, and does activities, and commands way faster, this puts many people questioning, will this change everything?</p>

    <!-- section 1 -->
    <h2 id="problems-for-education">The problems for Education</h2>
    <img src="IMG_20240113_190546.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="problem for education" title="The problems for Education">
    <p>Education has been around us for many millennia and has always been a staple for teaching people, and educating them in various fields they might be interested in, or professions that they want to get, but with this upcoming Super-human AI, education might be at a risk. In this present day we are already seeing lots of cheating with using AI for generating Essays, and even solving students' Chemistry problems, now some might say that this is not cheating, and AI could also teach the students how to solve it, but another problem arises, AI could also possibly replace our Educators seeing as AI can do more for them in a short amount of time, without lag. This could put the Educating Job at risk, and the World of education to an unpredictable path.</p>

    <!-- section 2 -->
    <h2 id="ai-taking-over">AI taking Over</h2>
    <img src="IMG_20240113_190728.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="ai taking over" title="AI taking Over">
    <p>ChatGPT might be smarter, adaptable, and more efficient than most of us Humans combined, the power of AI has been evolving more, and more through the years and we might even see a future with AI taking over us. Now this might be quite exaggerating since AI is still in its early stages, but their potential danger involving this subject cannot be ignored, as AI are being integrated and used with Many companies, we would see a decline on many employees for remote jobs like for programming and coding, or writing online with AI being this powerful, and very cheap we could face a problem for our economy in the future if AI keeps evolving even more faster.</p>

    <!-- section 3 -->
    <h2 id="being-dependent">Being Dependent</h2>
    <img src="IMG_20240113_190805.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="being dependent" title="Being Dependent">
    <p>This subject revolves on many of the problems with AI, and it's us, for humans the dependence on AI with Education, and Employment. But on the bright side this means we have more flexibility on learning, and more efficient at studying, but this poses a problem on us for the future as the possibility of learning from them, could turn to being dependent on them this would mean that our education, and many people's education would turn useless, or get more unused as we could just input all of our problems, request, and questions on an AI Chatbox and we could get the solution we want. Or at least we think, but this poses another problem which is:</p>

    <!-- section 4 -->
    <h2 id="the-illusion">The Illusion</h2>
    <img src="IMG_20240113_190914.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="the illusion" title="The Illusion">
    <p>The illusion puts emphasis on having Humans being adapted with AI being the source of our solutions, and desires could turn out to be false and an Illusion, the queries, and request we may give to our trusty AI may turn out to turn false, or a misinformation, but this misinformation is specified on a isolated subject, now we'll look at the illusion with bigger impact which is the Art, and Beauty, as well as music, and creativity with AI. Open AI like ChatGPT creates intricate arts in a matter of seconds, produces creativity that most humans won't think of creating in a matter of seconds, and beautiful images of Women that many lonely men get invested in, and the impact they would have in Traditions, and Culture. Now this topic is still far from reality but the possibility is there, and the creativity, and our unique view in arts may change in the future with AI.</p>

    <!-- section 5 -->
    <h2 id="being-unstoppable">Being Unstoppable</h2>
    <img src="IMG_20240113_191036.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="being dependent" title="Being Dependent">
    <p>AI is now easily integrated with lots of companies using them regularly, for cost-efficient work, and quick work for the job, now lots of arguments have been made around the AI, that if we are encountering problems with it, we could just flip the switch off, but the development of AI is rapidly growing, and many company are integrating them with their system, improving them, and making their own improved, and even stronger version, and that version may get improved even more, this raises a question for us if we could flip the switch, where would that be? AI is now getting more and more powerful, and smarter, most of us are now easily outsmarted by the said AI, and if time goes on AI might be more powerful, and get unstoppable and the "Flip the Switch Off" method we've been recalling as a way to stop, may turn to just an illusion.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Hopefully This gets the message on why AI is possibly dangerous for us, now some of these problems may be set for a future far away from now, but some of the problems are already happening around us. These are informative blogs made with research, and creativity but it is still lacking, in many fields, but there are more articles, and blogs out there that provide more useful information than this, but hopefully, the content we provide would suffice you.</p>
